  <h2>Journal and Time Audit</h2>
  <h5>2/3/2025</h5>
  <p>Today I woke up at 3:15am. Showered, dressed, and left the house by 4:00am. 
    I arrived at work at 6:00am. I ate 2 bananas and started my RoadTo230 page. I want to journal and keep up with everything I do and lessons I learned and stuggles I am going through to help my son Oliver Gene Self
  for when he gets older.</p>
