    <h1>Road To 230</h1>
     <p>Current PRs</p>
  <p>Lowest weight:321.6lb | 1 mile time(treadmill): 9:42 | 10 min stairclimb: 29 floors climbed | 20 min stairclimb: 58 floors climbed</p>
    <h3>Current diet goals</h3>
    <p>I did a fitness survey to see what calories I should be consuming based on my current weight and goals. The magic number was 2253 calories. I rounded that up to 2300. So I currently am trying 
    to get in as much protien as possible and stay below that 2300 calorie mark. Some days are real easy. Some days have been hard. But I have definetly found that the more solid sources of protien I eat (lean meats)
    the easier it is to eat less.</p>
    <h3>My current split(trial run)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sunday - Rest (low carb and OMAD day)</li>
      <li>Monday - Push(emphasis on shoulder growth) 1 mile run</li>
      <li>Tuesday - Pull(emphasis on back, [bent row, pullups, pull downs]) 1 mile run</li>
      <li>Wednesday - Long Stairclimb (20-30 min)</li>
      <li>Thursday - Push(emphasis on chest growth and tricep strength) 1 mile run</li>
      <li>Friday - Pull(emphasis on biceps and traps and rear delts [maybe some deadlifts to start?])</li>
      <li>Saturday - Legs(Big powerful and high volume leg day. Back Squats, RDLs, Hip AB and AD duction machine. Maybe some lunges)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This year my goal is to lose 100 pounds. On January 14th I weighed 328.4 pounds. My ultimate goal is to weigh 230 by either the end of the year or by Jan 14th of next year. Today is 2/3/2025. I plan on documenting this journey everyday until I reach my goal.</p>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>Throughout this 1 year journey I have certain milestones I want to reach. After each workout I plan to either run 1 mile or walk 10 min on the stair climber. I want to get a faster mile time as well as be able to climb more flights of stairs each session. I will
  be tracking my mile times and my flights of stairs climbed per 10 min and 20 min and maybe even 30 min</p
  <p>I plan on logging a journal each day. Documenting my weight, the food I eat, and the workout I did that day. I have always needed to journal and needed to lose weight and be healthy. So this is two birds one stone.</p>
